Sub files inside the zip file:
	1. GameFrame.java+GameFrame.class: source code file that contains the frame, canvas and main method to start the game.

Game Instruction:
1. Press up, down, left, right arrow keys to play the game
2. Press “r” to restart
3. Press “q” to quit
4. The total valid move and maximum number in the board for the current period s printed whenever you choose to quit or restart.

Implementations I Made:
1. I use dialogue boxes to ask the user if they really want to quit or start.
2. I use dialogue boxes to inform the user their valid move and maximum number
3. I ask the user if they want to restart a new round if the game is over
4. I included the sound effect of key pressing and looping background music so please make sure you volume is on. 

THANKS!!!
